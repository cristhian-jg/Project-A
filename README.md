With recent trends such as social networks, I have planned this new application for Android devices called (NAME APP), aimed mainly at photography, which will allow users to locate geographic areas or zones where they can take a good photo. It will be an intuitive and versatile application with social networks, so that the user can directly share the photographs he takes from the application. In itself, the application will be a small social network with a community where these areas will be decided by validating or scoring all users. It will be available both for mobile and tablet devices, it will be published in the Google Play Store for later download and use.
